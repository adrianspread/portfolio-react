          Since beginning my journey as a student of SPICED Academy on November
          2019, programming became my real passion right next to the jazz music.
          After boot camp I've done a lot of courses creating full stack
          projects and improving my skills. The more I know about programming,
          the more I feel the need to learn. I'm naturally curious, open minded
          and I love to work in a team :)
